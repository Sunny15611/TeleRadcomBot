IAB-MT, which are forwarded to the IAB-donor-CU through the target parent node IAB-DU. These UL packets
belong to the IAB-MT’s own signalling and, optionally, data traffic.
11. The IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer routing entries on the target path between
the target parent IAB-node and target IAB-donor-DU as well as DL mappings on the target IAB-donor-DU for
the migrating IAB-node’s target path. These configurations may be performed at an earlier stage, e.g.
immediately after step 3, or before step 3. The IAB-donor-CU may establish additional BH RLC channels to the
migrating IAB-MT via RRC message.
12. The F1-C connections are switched to use the migrating IAB-node’s new TNL address(es), IAB-donor-CU
updates the UL BH information associated to each GTP-tunnel to migrating IAB-node. This step may also
update UL FTEID and DL FTEID associated to each GTP-tunnel. All F1-U tunnels are switched to use the
migrating IAB-node’s new TNL address(es). This step may use non-UE associated signaling in E1 and/or F1
interface to provide updated UP configuration for F1-U tunnels of multiple connected UEs or child IAB-MTs.
The IAB-donor-CU may also update the UL BH information associated with non-UP traffic. Implementation
must ensure the avoidance of potential race conditions, i.e. no conflicting configurations are concurrently
performed using UE-associated and non-UE-associated procedures.
In case IPsec tunnel mode is used for TNL protection, the IAB-node may use MOBIKE (IETF RFC 4555 [29])
to migrate the IPsec tunnel to the new IP outer addresses. After the completion of the MOBIKE procedure, the
IAB-DU initiates an F1AP gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure from which the IAB-donor-CU can
conclude whether the existing inner IP address(es) (e.g. for SCTP association) and the DL F-TEID can be
reused.
If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP association(s) between the migrating IAB-node
and the IAB-donor-CU may be established using the new TNL address information of the migrating IAB-node.
The migrating IAB-node sends an F1AP gNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the IAB-donor-
CU, which may include new (outer) IP addresses and corresponding new (inner) IP address for the F1-U traffic
to be switched to the target path.
13. The IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the source parent node IAB-
DU.
14. The source parent node IAB-DU releases the migrating IAB-MT’s context and responds to the IAB-donor-CU
with a UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message.
15. The IAB-donor-CU releases BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer routing entries on the source path between
source parent IAB-node and source IAB-donor-DU.
NOTE:
 In case that the source path and target path have common nodes, the BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer
routing entries of those nodes may not need to be released in Step 15.
Steps 11, 12 and 15 should also be performed for the migrating IAB-node’s descendant nodes, as follows:
The IAB-donor-CU may allocate new TNL address(es) that is (are) routable via the target IAB-donor-DU to
the descendent nodes via RRCReconfiguration message.
If needed, the IAB-donor-CU may also provide a new default UL mapping which includes a default BH RLC
channel and a default BAP Routing ID for UL F1-C/non-F1 traffic on the target path, to the descendant nodes
via RRCReconfiguration message.
If needed, the IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels, BAP-sublayer routing entries and BH RLC
channel mappings on the target path for the descendant nodes in the same manner as described for the
migrating IAB-node in step 11.

The descendant nodes switch their F1-C connections and F1-U tunnels to new TNL addresses that are
anchored at the new IAB-donor-DU, in the same manner as described for the migrating IAB-node in step 12.
Based on implementation, these steps can be performed after or in parallel with the handover of the migrating
IAB-node.
To enable performing these steps in parallel, the IAB-donor-CU sends the RRCReconfiguration message
with the new TNL address(es) and the new default BAP configuration to the descendent node while the
migrating IAB-MT is still connected with source parent node, for example, before Step 5. In this case, the UE
CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message carrying this RRCReconfiguration message includes a
conditional delivery indication for the descendent node’s parent IAB-DU. Based on this indication, the parent
IAB-DU retains the RRCReconfiguration message until the conditions for delivery are met, as specified in
TS 38.473 [4]. The IAB-donor-CU may further configure the BAP-sublayer routing entries on the migrating
IAB-node and the descendant nodes while the migrating IAB-MT is still connected with the source parent
node.
NOTE:
NOTE:
NOTE:
In upstream direction, in-flight packets between the source parent node and the IAB-donor-CU can be
delivered even after the target path is established.
In-flight downlink data in the source path may be discarded, up to implementation via the NR user plane
protocol (TS 38.425 [24]).

is based on a Measurement Configuration the dual-connecting IAB-MT received from the IAB-donor-CU
before.
2.The first parent node IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the IAB-donor-CU to
convey the received MeasurementReport.
3. The IAB-donor-CU sends the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the second parent node IAB-DU,
to create the UE context for the dual-connecting IAB-MT and to set up one or more bearers. These bearers can
be used by the dual-connecting IAB-MT for its own signalling, and, optionally, data traffic.
4. The second parent node IAB-DU responds to the IAB-donor-CU with a UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE
message.
5.The IAB-donor-CU sends a DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the first parent node IAB-DU, which
includes a generated RRCReconfiguration message. The RRCReconfiguration message may contain one or more
TNL address(es) for the dual-connecting IAB-DU, which are anchored at the second-path IAB-donor-DU. The
IAB-donor-CU can proactively obtain these TNL addresses from the second-path IAB-donor-DU. In case IPsec
tunnel mode is used to protect the F1 and non-F1 traffic, the allocated TNL address is the outer IP address. The
TNL address allocation is not necessary if the first and second paths use the same IAB-donor-DU.
6. The first parent node IAB-DU forwards the received RRCReconfiguration message to the dual-connecting IAB-
MT.
7. The dual-connecting IAB-MT responds to the first parent node IAB-DU with an RRCReconfigurationComplete
message.
8. The first parent node IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the IAB-donor-CU, to
convey the received RRCReconfigurationComplete message.
9. A Random Access procedure is performed at the second parent node IAB-DU.
10. The IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels and BAP-layer route entries on the second path between dual-
connecting IAB-node and second-path IAB-donor-DU. These configurations may be performed at an earlier
stage, e.g. immediately after step 3.
11. The new TNL addresses allocated in step 5 (if any) are added to the dual-connecting IAB-DU’s F1-C
association(s) with the IAB-donor-CU. The IAB-donor-CU may configure new UL BH information on the
second path for F1AP messages.
If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP association(s) between the dual-connecting
IAB-node and the IAB-donor-CU may be established using the new TNL address information of the dual-
connecting IAB-node. The dual-connecting IAB-node sends an F1AP gNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message to the IAB-donor-CU, which may include new (outer) IP addresses and corresponding new (inner) IP
address for the F1-U traffic to be switched to the target path.
12. The IAB-donor-CU may migrate the F1-U tunnels it has with the dual-connecting IAB-DU from the first path to
the second path via the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message.
13. The dual-connectivity IAB-DU replies with a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.
Steps 12 and 13 can be performed for a subset of UE bearers, e.g., to balance the load between the first and the second
path.
In case the second path is used for the dual-connecting IAB-node’s descendant node(s), Steps 10 and 11 are also
performed for the descendant node(s), as follows:
When the second path uses a different IAB-donor-DU, the IAB-donor-CU shall configure the descendent IAB-
DU(s) with one or more new TNL addresses, which are anchored on the IAB-donor-DU of the second path.
If needed, the IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels, BAP-layer route entries on the target path for the
descendant nodes and the BH RLC channel mappings on the descendant nodes in the same manner as
described for the dual-connecting IAB-node in step 10.

path to carry F1AP messages.
The IAB-donor-CU may migrate the F1-U tunnels it has with the dual-connecting IAB-node’s descendant
node(s) from the first path to the second path, as described for step 12.

0. The UE is connected and can transmit/receive data to/from gNB-DU1 and gNB-DU2.
1. gNB-DU1 realizes that the radio link towards the UE is experiencing outage.
2. gNB-DU1 sends the ""Radio Link Outage"" notification message to the gNB-CU over the F1-U interface, as part

gNB-CU to perform retransmission of the PDCP PDUs that were not delivered by the gNB-DU1 (e.g. the highest
transmitted NR PDCP Sequence Number, the highest successfully delivered NR PDCP Sequence Number and
the lost NR-U Sequence Numbers).
3. gNB-CU decides to switch data traffic transmission and retransmission of PDCP PDUs that were undelivered in
gNB-DU1 via gNB-DU2. gNB-CU stops sending downlink traffic to gNB-DU1. The radio leg between gNB-

air indication from eNB (transmitted in SIB1). To indicate its IAB capability, the IAB-MT includes the IAB-node
indication in RRCConnectionSetupComplete message, to assist the eNB to select an MME supporting IAB. The
eNB then configures the IAB-MT part with an NR measurement configuration in order to perform discovery,
measurement and measurement reporting of candidate gNBs. To enable the eNB choose an en-gNB which supports
IAB function, the IAB capability of neighbour gNBs can be pre-configured in the eNB (e.g. by OAM).
NOTE: Other ways to enable the eNB know the IAB capability of neighbour gNBs are not precluded.
Phase 1-2. SgNB addition. In this phase, the IAB-MT part connects to the parent node IAB-DU and IAB-donor-
CU via the EN-DC SgNB Addition procedure. The procedure defined in clause 8.4.1 is reused. The eNB includes
“IAB Node Indication” in SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message to inform the IAB-donor-CU that the request
is for an IAB-node. In addition, SRB3 can be set up for the IAB-MT, to transmit RRC message between the IAB-
MT and the IAB-donor-CU via the NR links directly.
Phase 2-1: BH RLC channel establishment. This phase is the same as Phase 2-1 in the standalone IAB integration
procedure (refer to the Phase 2-1 in clause 8.12.1). This step may occur in Phase 1-2.
Phase 2-2: Routing update. This phase is the same as Phase 2-2 in the standalone IAB integration procedure (refer
to the Phase 2-2 in clause 8.12.1), except that the IP traffic on the F1-C interface may be transmitted via the MeNB.
Phase 3. IAB-DU part setup. This phase is the same as Phase 3 in the standalone IAB integration procedure (refer
to the Phase 3 in clause 8.12.1), except that the IP traffic on the F1-C interface may be transmitted via the MeNB.
The IAB-donor-CU decides to only configure LTE leg, or only to configure NR leg, or to configure both LTE leg
and NR leg, to be used for F1-C traffic transfer. The configuration may be performed before IAB-DU part setup.
IAB-donor-CU may also change the configuration after IAB-DU part setup. In case the configuration is not
performed before IAB-DU part setup, the IAB node uses the NR leg as the default one. When both LTE leg and
NR leg are configured, it is up to the implementation to select the leg for F1-C traffic transfer.",83.png

FTEID and DL FTEID associated with individual GTP-tunnel(s). The affected GTP tunnel(s) will be switched to
use the dual-connecting IAB-node’s new TNL address(es). This step may use non-UE associated signaling in E1
and/or F1 interface to provide updated UP configuration for F1-U tunnels of multiple connected UEs or child
IAB-MTs. Implementation must ensure the avoidance of potential race conditions, i.e., that no conflicting
configurations are concurrently performed using UE-associated and non-UE-associated procedures.
The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may also provide UL BH information associated with non-UP traffic. New
TNL addresses for F1-C traffic configured in step 3, if any, can be added to the dual-connecting IAB-DU’s F1-C
association(s) with the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.
If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP association(s) between the dual-connecting
IAB-node and the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may be established using the new TNL address information of
the dual-connecting IAB-node. The dual-connecting IAB-node sends an F1AP gNB-DU CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message to the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, which may include new (outer) IP addresses and
corresponding new (inner) IP address for offloaded F1-U traffic.

HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. The RRC configuration includes a BAP address for the
boundary node in the target IAB-donor-CU’s topology, a default BH RLC channel and a default BAP routing ID
configuration for UL F1-C/non-F1 traffic mapping on the target path. The RRC configuration may include the
new TNL address(es) anchored at the target IAB-donor-DU for the migrating node.
5.The source IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the source parent
node IAB-DU, which includes the received RRCReconfiguration message from the target IAB-donor-CU.
6. The source parent node IAB-DU forwards the received RRCReconfiguration message to the migrating IAB-MT.
7.The source parent node IAB-DU responds to the source IAB-donor-CU with the UE CONTEXT

target path is used for transport of traffic between the migrating node and the source IAB-donor-CU.
13. The source IAB-donor-CU may release BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer routing entries on the source path
between source parent IAB-node of the migrating IAB-node and the source IAB-donor-DU.
14. The target IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer routing entries on the target path
between the migrating IAB-node and target IAB-donor-DU, as well as DL mappings on the target IAB-donor-
DU for the migrating IAB-node’s target path. These configurations support the transport of F1-C traffic on the
target path.
15. The F1-C connection between the migrating IAB-node and the source IAB-donor-CU are switched to the target
path using the new TNL address information of the migrating IAB-node. The migrating IAB-node may report
the new TNL address information it wants to use for F1-U traffic to the source IAB-donor-CU, via the gNB-DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
In case IPsec tunnel mode is used for TNL protection, the migrating IAB-node may use MOBIKE (IETF RFC
4555 [29]) to migrate the IPsec tunnel to the new IP outer addresses. After the completion of the MOBIKE
procedure, the migrating IAB-DU initiates an F1AP gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure from which the
IAB-donor-CU can conclude whether the existing inner IP address(es) (e.g., for SCTP association) and the DL
F-TEID can be reused.
If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP association(s) between the migrating IAB-node
and the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may be established using the new TNL address information of the
migrating IAB-node. The migrating IAB-node sends an F1AP gNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message

and non-UP traffic on the target path.
18. The target IAB-donor-CU responds to the source IAB-donor-CU with an IAB Transport Migration Management
Response message, to provide the mapping information for the traffic to be offloaded. The message includes the
L2 info that is used in the target IAB-donor-CU’s topology and necessary to configure the migrating IAB-node
with the UL mappings of traffic indicated in step 16. The message includes the DSCP/IPv6 Flow Label values
used to configure the DL mappings of traffic indicated in step 16.
19. The F1-U connections of the migrating IAB-node with the source IAB-donor-CU are switched to use the
migrating IAB-node’s new TNL address(es). The source IAB-donor-CU provides to the IAB-DU of the
migrating IAB-node the updated UL BH information for the traffic indicated in step 16, based on the UL BH
information received from the target IAB-donor-CU in step 18. The source IAB-donor-CU may also update the
UL BH information associated with non-UP traffic. This step may use UE associated signaling or non-UE
associated signaling in E1 and/or F1 interface. Implementation must ensure the avoidance of potential race
conditions, i.e., that no conflicting configurations are concurrently performed using UE-associated and non-UE-
associated procedures.
20. The steps 16 to 19 may be repeated, if needed, where the source IAB-donor-CU can request the offload of
further traffic, or the modification or release of offloaded traffic. The target IAB-donor-CU can fully or partially
reject addition or modification requests by the source IAB-donor-CU.",99.png
